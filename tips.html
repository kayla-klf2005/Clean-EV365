     <li="TIP"><h3>8.	Take advantage of the many drop-off recycling opportunities</h3>
     -SWMCOL(Solid Waste Management Company Limited), in partnership with iCare, have come together to create recycling drop-off points at certain locations in the country. Persons are asked to place their recyclables in see-through plastic bags according to the recyclable categories  (Plastics, aluminum, cardboard boxes, and electronic wastes) and drop it off in the bin closest to you. These bins are then emptied and taken for recycling
